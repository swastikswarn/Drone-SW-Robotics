## 🧩 What is Covered in Part 1?

Part 1 focuses on collecting and preparing all physical components required for the drone.  
You will have:

- A strong **Q450 quadcopter frame**  
- **4 brushless motors** for flight  
- **4 ESCs** for motor control  
- A **FlySky transmitter & receiver** for radio communication  
- **Li-Po battery + XT60 connector** for safe power delivery  
- **Propellers** (CW & CCW) for lift  
- **Arduino UNO R4** for the flight controller base  
- **MPU6050** sensor for gyroscope + accelerometer  
- **Cable ties** for neat assembly  
- **Li-Po balance charger** to safely charge batteries

## 🚀 Drone Overview

In this project, we are building a **basic quadcopter (X-configuration)** using:

- A2212 BLDC motors  
- 30A ESCs  
- Q450 frame  
- Arduino-based flight controller  
- MPU6050 for stabilization  
- FlySky CT6B transmitter system  

This drone is designed for **learning, experimentation, and understanding flight control systems**.  
The next parts will include wiring, flight control code, calibration, and test flights.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure to use proper **Li-Po safety precautions**.  
- Double-check motor direction and propeller orientation during assembly.  
- Use cable ties to secure ESCs and wires neatly on the frame.
